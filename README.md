# Mental Health in the Tech Industry
## Asuka Li, Gitika Chaudhry (Emory University Quantitative Sciences Department)

### Motivation of project:
Over 55 million people work in the tech industry and amongst those, over 50% has been diagnosed with a mental health disorder. At the same time, as a Quantitative Sciences (Data Science) major, we thought it'd be prevalent to us as we may get job positions in the tech industry post-graduation. We decided to investigate the over the years movement and impacts of mental health on employees in the tech industry.
