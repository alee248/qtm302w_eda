# Mental Health in the Tech Industry
## Asuka Li, Gitika Chaudhry (Emory University Quantitative Sciences Department)

### Motivation of project:
Over 55 million people work in the tech industry and amongst those, over 50% has been diagnosed with a mental health disorder. At the same time, as a Quantitative Sciences (Data Science) major, we thought it'd be prevalent to us as we may get job positions in the tech industry post-graduation. We decided to investigate the over the years movement and impacts of mental health on employees in the tech industry.

### Methods


### Languages Used
We completed the entire project using Python.

### Project Description
We decided to focus on the question "What is the overall impact of mental health in the tech industry?" for the poster project, while we've explore multiple other relationships in the data cleaning file. During the process, we explored the demographis of the population who participated in the study. We looked at the gender and age columns, which gave us insights into the workplace distribution of the population. With these information in mind, we decided to dig further into the demographics of those who acknowledged their mental health issues. Furthermore, more specifically, we also looked at the trend for number of people who's becoming comfortable about talking to their direct supervisors about their mental health issues. Some challenges we've faced in this project is during the data cleaning process. Due to the datasets with inconsistent columns and number of records, we spent a lot of time on the preprocessing of the dataset. Some potential next steps are to conduct some linear regression model onto the data with more evenly distributed records to identify the accurate potential trend in different relationships.  
  
Instructions for getting started on the repo:  
All the data files are contained in the main branch of the repository. You can click on the Binder URL above and get started on the jupyter notebook virtual system. You should already be able to see all the graphs we've created and the data cleaning process we've conducted, if you'd like to explore more on your own on the data we have, feel free to download "data.csv" and conduct more EDA or any models on it.
